# Riak Ruby Client (riak-client) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/basho/riak-ruby-client.png)](http://travis-ci.org/basho/riak-ruby-client)

`riak-client` is a rich Ruby client/toolkit for Riak, Basho's
distributed database that contains a basic wrapper around typical
operations, including bucket manipulation, object CRUD, link-walking,
and map-reduce.

## Dependencies

`riak-client` requires i18n, builder, beefcake, and multi_json. For
higher performance on HTTP requests, install the 'excon' gem. The
cache store implementation requires ActiveSupport 3 or later.

Development dependencies are handled with bundler. Install bundler
(`gem install bundler`) and run this command in each sub-project to
get started:

``` bash
$ bundle install
```

Run the RSpec suite using `bundle exec`:

``` bash
$ bundle exec rake
```

## Basic Example

``` ruby
require 'riak'

# Create a client interface
client = Riak::Client.new

# Create a client interface that uses Excon
client = Riak::Client.new(:http_backend => :Excon)

# Create a client that uses Protocol Buffers
client = Riak::Client.new(:protocol => "pbc")

# Automatically balance between multiple nodes
client = Riak::Client.new(:nodes => [
  {:host => '10.0.0.1'},
  {:host => '10.0.0.2', :pb_port => 1234},
  {:host => '10.0.0.3', :http_port => 5678}
])

# Retrieve a bucket
bucket = client.bucket("doc")  # a Riak::Bucket

# Get an object from the bucket
object = bucket.get_or_new("index.html")   # a Riak::RObject

# Change the object's data and save
object.raw_data = "<html><body>Hello, world!</body></html>"
object.content_type = "text/html"
object.store

# Reload an object you already have
object.reload                  # Works if you have the key and vclock, using conditional GET
object.reload :force => true   # Reloads whether you have the vclock or not

# Access more like a hash, client[bucket][key]
client['doc']['index.html']   # the Riak::RObject

# Create a new object
new_one = Riak::RObject.new(bucket, "application.js")
new_one.content_type = "application/javascript" # You must set the content type.
new_one.raw_data = "alert('Hello, World!')"
new_one.store
```

## Map-Reduce Example

``` ruby
# Assuming you've already instantiated a client, get the album titles for The Beatles
results = Riak::MapReduce.new(client).
                add("artists","Beatles").
                link(:bucket => "albums").
                map("function(v){ return [JSON.parse(v.values[0].data).title]; }", :keep => true).run

p results # => ["Please Please Me", "With The Beatles", "A Hard Day's Night", 
          #     "Beatles For Sale", "Help!", "Rubber Soul",
          #     "Revolver", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "Magical Mystery Tour", 
          #     "The Beatles", "Yellow Submarine", "Abbey Road", "Let It Be"]
```


## Riak Search Examples

For more information about Riak Search, see [the Basho wiki](http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search.html).

``` ruby
# Create a client, specifying the Solr-compatible endpoint
# When connecting to Riak 0.14 and later, the Solr endpoint configuration option is not necessary.
client = Riak::Client.new :solr => "/solr"

# Search the default index for documents
result = client.search("title:Yesterday") # Returns a vivified JSON object
                                          # containing 'responseHeaders' and 'response' keys
result['response']['numFound'] # total number of results
result['response']['start']    # offset into the total result set
result['response']['docs']     # the list of indexed documents

# Search the 'users' index for documents
client.search("users", "name:Sean")

# Add a document to an index
client.index("users", {:id => "sean@basho.com", :name => "Sean Cribbs"}) # adds to the 'users' index

client.index({:id => "index.html", :content => "Hello, world!"}) # adds to the default index

client.index({:id => 1, :name => "one"}, {:id => 2, :name => "two"}) # adds multiple docs

# Remove document(s) from an index
client.remove({:id => 1})             # removes the document with ID 1
client.remove({:query => "archived"}) # removes all documents matching query
client.remove({:id => 1}, {:id => 5}) # removes multiple docs

client.remove("users", {:id => "sean@basho.com"}) # removes from the 'users' index

# Seed MapReduce with search results
Riak::MapReduce.new(client).
        search("users","email:basho").
        map("Riak.mapValuesJson", :keep => true).
        run

# Detect whether a bucket has auto-indexing
client['users'].is_indexed?

# Enable auto-indexing on a bucket
client['users'].enable_index!

# Disable auto-indexing on a bucket
client['users'].disable_index!
```

## Secondary Index Examples

Riak supports secondary indexes. Secondary indexing, or "2i," gives you the 
ability to tag objects with multiple queryable values at write time, and then
query them later.

* [Using Secondary Indexes](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/2i/)
* [Secondary Index implementation notes](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/advanced/2i/)

### Tagging Objects

Objects are tagged with a hash kept behind the `indexes` method. Secondary index
storage logic is in `lib/riak/rcontent.rb`.

```ruby
object = bucket.get_or_new 'cobb.salad'

# Indexes end with the "_bin" suffix to indicate they're binary or string 
# indexes. They can have multiple values.
object.indexes[:ingredients_bin] = %w{lettuce tomato bacon egg chives}

# Indexes ending with the "_int" suffix are indexed as integers. They can
# have multiple values too.
object.indexes[:calories_int] = [220]

# You must re-save the object to store indexes.
object.store
```

### Finding Objects

Secondary index queries return a list of keys exactly matching a scalar or 
within a range.

```ruby
# The Bucket#get_index method allows querying by scalar...
bucket.get_index 'calories_int', 220 # => ['cobb.salad']

# or range.
bucket.get_index 'calories_int', 100..300 # => ['cobb.salad']

# Binary indexes also support both ranges and scalars.
bucket.get_index 'ingredients_bin', 'tomata'..'tomatz' # => ['cobb.salad']

# The collection from #get_index also provides a continuation for pagination:
c = bucket.get_index 'ingredients_bin', 'lettuce', max_results: 5
c.length # => 5
c.continuation # => "g2gCbQAAA="

# You can use that continuation to get the next page of results:
c2 = bucket.get_index 'ingredients_bin', 'lettuce', max_results: 5, continuation: c.continuation

# More complicated operations may benefit by using the `SecondaryIndex` object:
q = Riak::SecondaryIndex.new bucket, 'ingredients_bin', 'lettuce', max_results: 5

# SecondaryIndex objects give you access to the keys...
q.keys # => ['cobb.salad', 'wedge.salad', 'buffalo_chicken.wrap', ...]

# but can also fetch values for you in parallel.
q.values # => [<RObject {recipes,cobb.salad} ...>, <RObject {recipes,wedge...

# They also provide simpler pagination:
q.has_next_page? # => true
q2 = q.next_page
```

## How to Contribute

* Fork the project on [Github](http://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client).  If you have already forked, use `git pull --rebase` to reapply your changes on top of the mainline. Example:

    ``` bash
    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull --rebase basho master
    ```
* Create a topic branch. If you've already created a topic branch, rebase it on top of changes from the mainline "master" branch. Examples:
  * New branch:

        ``` bash
        $ git checkout -b topic
        ```
  * Existing branch:

        ``` bash
        $ git rebase master
        ```
* Write an RSpec example or set of examples that demonstrate the necessity and validity of your changes. **Patches without specs will most often be ignored. Just do it, you'll thank me later.** Documentation patches need no specs, of course.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix. Make your specs and stories pass (green).
* Run the suite using multiruby or rvm to ensure cross-version compatibility.
* Cleanup any trailing whitespace in your code (try @whitespace-mode@ in Emacs, or "Remove Trailing Spaces in Document" in the "Text" bundle in Textmate). You can use the `clean_whitespace` Rake task if you like.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile. If related to an existing issue in the [tracker](http://github.com/basho/ruby-riak-client/issues), include "Closes #X" in the commit message (where X is the issue number).
* Send a pull request to the Basho repository.
